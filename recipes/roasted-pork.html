      <h2 class="sub-title">The recipe of Slow-Roasted Pork</h2>
      <p class="content">Slow-roasting the pork with liquid (a mix of ale and water) in the pan makes the meat fall-apart tender. A blast of heat at the end crisps the skin.</p>
  
      <h2 class="sub-title">Slow-Roasted Pork Ingredients</h2>
      <ul class="content">
        <li>Coarse salt</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons turbinado sugar or light-brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons finely grated fresh ginger</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons whole cloves, crushed into a coarse powder</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons mustard powder, such as Colman's</li>
        <li>1 skin-on, bone-in pork shoulder (also known as picnic shoulder; 8 pounds)</li>
        <li>1 bottle (12 ounces) Belgian ale or pale ale</li>
        <li>1 pint kumquats (about 10 ounces), halved</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons honey</li>
      </ul>
  
      <h2 class="sub-title">Steps</h2>
      <ol class="content">
        <li>Combine 1/4 cup salt, sugar, ginger, cloves, and mustard powder in a small bowl.</li>
        <li>Using a sharp knife, score skin (but not meat) on top and sides of pork in a diamond pattern at 1/2-inch intervals, leaving bone end unscored. Make about a dozen 1/2-inch-deep slits into flesh on top and underside using the tip of the knife. Transfer pork to a rimmed baking sheet or baking dish, and rub spice mixture into scored skin and flesh. Refrigerate, loosely covered with parchment, 12 to 24 hours.</li>
        <li>Let pork stand at room temperature for 1 1/2 to 2 hours before roasting. Uncover.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 325 degrees. Transfer pork to a clean rimmed baking sheet and pat skin dry. Pour beer and 1 1/2 cups water into baking sheet and wrap entire sheet in foil. Carefully transfer pork to oven and roast until meat is tender when pierced with a fork, about 3 hours and 15 minutes. Uncover pork.</li>
        <li>Toss kumquats with honey. Add to baking sheet, turning to coat. Roast until tender and lightly caramelized, about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Raise oven temperature to 425 degrees. Roast until pork skin is crisp and dark brown, 8 to 10 minutes. Let pork rest, tented with foil, for 45 minutes before carving. Serve with kumquats in pan juices.</li>
      </ol>
