    <h2>The recipe of Classic Cheesecake</h2>
    <p>The perfect classic cheesecake is rich, not too dense, silky smooth, and as creamy as can be. Our recipe combines a handful of simple ingredients to make a satisfying dessert that everyone loves. You could serve this cheesecake as is for celebrations of any kind, but if you want to go the extra mile, try a drizzle of melted dark chocolate or a handful of fresh berries on top.</p>
    <p>A buttery graham cracker crust makes this dessert an instant classic. The crumbly texture is a perfect complement to the velvety smooth cream cheese filling.</p>
